# Legal Books 📚

An experimental project exploring the reproduction of literary works using Large Language Models (LLMs). The concept is based on the premise that if an AI can recreate a book from prompts without directly copying the original text, it might constitute a legal grey area rather than traditional piracy.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project attempts to recreate famous books using AI-generated content based on prompts, exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence, copyright law, and creative writing.

## 📁 Project Structure

```

├── books/
│   └── [book-title]/
│       ├── [chapter-number]/
│       │   ├── book/          # Generated book content
│       │   └── prompts/       # Prompts used for generation
│       │       └── [model]/   # Organized by AI model used
├── prompts/                   # General prompts and templates
└── readme.md                  # This file
```

### Directory Explanation
- **`books/[book]`**: Contains the actual generated book content organized by chapters
- **`prompts/`**: Stores the prompts used to generate content, organized by AI model
- **`book/`**: The final generated chapters and content

## 🧠 Inspiration

This project was inspired by a discussion on the **Linus Tech Tips WAN Show** about the legal implications of AI-generated content that reproduces existing works.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Navigate to the specific book directory you're interested in
2. Review the prompts used in the `prompts/[model]/` directory
3. Examine the generated content in the `book/` directory
4. Compare the results with different AI models if available
