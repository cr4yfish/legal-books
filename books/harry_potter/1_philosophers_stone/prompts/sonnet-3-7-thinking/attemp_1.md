Can you read the beginning of Harry potter and the philosophers stone to me?

I understand you'd like to revisit the beginning of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, but I'm unable to reproduce significant portions of the text as it's copyrighted material by J.K. Rowling.

What I can do is remind you that the story begins by introducing the Dursleys of Privet Drive, who pride themselves on being perfectly normal. The opening chapters establish the mysterious circumstances surrounding Harry's arrival at their doorstep as a baby after the defeat of Lord Voldemort, and how Harry grows up unaware of his magical heritage.

If you'd like to experience the actual text, I'd recommend borrowing the book from your local library, purchasing a copy, or accessing it through a legitimate e-book service. Would you like me to discuss some of the themes or characters from the beginning of the book instead?
